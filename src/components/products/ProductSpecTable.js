    "Focal Length":
      "The distance that the light has to travel between the aperture and the focal point. A smaller focal lengths will deliver a wider field of view.",
    "F/Ratio":
      "The relationship between the focal length and the aperture, larger f/numbers imply higher magnification.",
    "Highest Practical Power":
      "Exceeding the Highest Practical Power will result in a fuzzy image.",

      "A low powered mini telescope with a wide field of view to assists with locating objects before observe through the main telescope.",
    Focuser: "Wider focusers allow for a wider field of view.",
    Diagonal:
      "A small triangular attachment for making it easier to observe through the telescope.",
    Eyepieces:
      "Short focal length (5-10mm) eyepieces generally provided high power magnifications.",

    "Secondary Mirror Diameter":
      "Bounces the light back to the primary mirror and through a hole in its center.",
    Obstruction:
      "The secondary mirror in optical systems creates a shadow, which reduces the contrast and effective aperture performance.",

    "Motors Resolution":
      "The smallest angular increment that a telescope mount's motor system can move.",
    "Encoders Resolution":
      "The smallest angular increment that can be measured by the encoders on a telescope's mount.",
