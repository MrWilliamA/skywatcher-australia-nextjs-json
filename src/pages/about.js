              &quot;I have used a great number of telescopes; some are good,
              some mediocre and some bad. To me the Sky-Watcher range of
              instruments are very good indeed & suited to amateurs of all kinds
              â€“ and they are not priced out of the market! Excellent value. Use
              them and enjoy them. &quot;
