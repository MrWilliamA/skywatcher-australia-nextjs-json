The Sky-Watcher 114/900 EQ1 Reflector Telescope is a fantastic telescope for the beginning amateur astronomer. It has the benefits of gathering 125% more light than a 76mm telescope and 165% more than a 70mm refractor showing better the main details in nebulae and cluster. With maximum practical magnification of 224x , this Sky-Watcher Telescope will reveal details in Saturn’s rings, Jupiter’s bands, the Martian polar ice caps, and the phases of Venus and the moon.</p> <p><strong>Equatorial Mount Features</strong></p> The EQ1 is a lightweight equatorial mount, able to compensate for Earth’s rotation by moving along only one axis. That is a great advantage for high resolution observation as it is only necessary to turn a single knob whilst tracking an object across the sky. The optional tracking motor can be easily attached to the right ascension axis, allowing comfortable observation without the work of manual tracking. Aligning an equatorial mount is an easy operation that can be completed in a few minutes. Once the tripod is levelled and the mount is orientated south, incline the mount at the same angle of your local latitude. For example, if you are in Sydney (latitude 33° South), adjust the mount inclination to 33° above the horizon using the scale on the EQ1 mount. <p><strong>Premium Imaging Performance</strong></p>Sky-Watcher guarantee diffraction limited optics for an outstanding quality. The aluminised primary mirror is aspheric (parabolic profile) offering an optical system free from spherical aberration. The secondary mirror is thin to allow fast cooling and it is held by extra thin spider supports for minimal diffraction spike effects on bright stars and increased contrast.</p><p><strong>In the Box:</strong></p><ul><li>114mm Newton Reflector</li><li>EQ1 Mount with Aluminium Tripod</li><li>Fine Tracking Adjustment Knobs</li><li>2 Eyepieces Super 10mm (90x) & Super 25mm (36x) – 1.25″ Barrel</li><li>2x Barlow Lens (double the magnifications of the eyepieces)</li><li>Finderscope 6×24</li><li>Instruction Manual</li></ul>",

The truss structure is compact, allowing for easy transportation while you’re in search of the perfect dark, pristine sky. The outstanding light gathering of the mirror and the superior resolution allow amazing journeys through the universe, offering spectacular observations of tangled gas filaments in nebulae, fine galaxy details and remarkable planet structures. Despite the size of the mirror, the telescope is easy to assemble following the step by step instructions and video.</p><p> To top it off, the Sky-Watcher Stargate is equipped with a 2″ Crayford dual speed focuser for smooth and precise focusing, and a focuser-locking screw.</p><p><strong>Stargate 500 SynScan Dobsonian Features</strong></p><ul> <li>User level; intermediate – professional</li> <li>Collapsible, transportable Dobsonian</li> <li>View moon, planets, comets, stars, galaxies and nebulae</li> <li>Truss tube with stiffening clamps</li> <li>Borosilicate aluminised mirrors protected by quartz coating</li> <li>Aluminium structure and base</li> <li>Diffraction Limited Parabolic Mirror</li> <li>Ultra Thin Secondary Mirror Support (only 2.50mm)</li> <li>M42 Thread for DSLR Connection</li> <li>Backed by 5 Years Sky-Watcher Limited Warranty</li></ul><p><strong>Stargate 500 SynScan Dobsonian Features</strong></p><p> The most extraordinary feature of the Stargate is the technology used in the mirrors. They are made up of borosilicate glass that has a very low expansion coefficient, reducing the stresses caused by thermal gradients. The primary mirror uses a special lightweight technology. In fact, the mirror is extremely light and thin, but the glass ribs beneath minimise the glass deformation, thus allowing continuous high performance in all the telescope angulations. Moreover, the small thickness of the mirror allows a much quicker cooling time compared to the standard monolithic mirrors. The secondary mirror has a honeycomb structure that follows the concept of the primary mirror: lightweight, rigid and quick to cool down.</p><p> Both the mirrors are aluminised and in order to protect the reflective treatment over the years, the coatings are protected by a thin layer of quartz (silicon dioxide). This protection is needed as the mirrors are exposed to external elements due to their position in an open truss tube. Sky-Watcher is one of the few companies in the world that use this particular technology.</p><p><strong>Computerized Synscan </strong></p><p> The Stargate Go-To is equipped with the Sky-Watcher SynScan that has in it’s memory 42,900 objects! Once the telescope is aligned, thousands of objects will be visible with a touch of a button; planets, the entire Messier catalogue, bright and double stars and the IC, NGC, SAO catalogues. In addition to this, the Deep Sky Tour function suggests a list of the most interesting deep sky objects so even the inexperienced astronomer can easily observe faint nebulae and galaxies.</p><p> The Freedom Find technology (dual-encoder) allows the telescope to be moved manually whenever the user wishes, but without losing any of the pre-set alignment.</p><p><strong>Accessories in the Box: </strong></p><ul> <li> SynScan hand controller with cables 12V power cable with lighter socket plug </li> <li> Finderscope 9X50 straight version Eyepiece 2″ LET 28mm (71x) – apparent filed </li> <li> of view 56° Eyepiece 1.25″ Super Plossl 10mm (200x) – apparent filed of view </li> <li> 52° Eyepiece adapter from 2″ to 1.25″ with M42 thread 2″ tube extension </li> <li>Collimation Eyepiece User Manual</li></ul>",

This telescope collect 459x more light than the unaided eye and in good conditions, the resolution can reach 0.80″. This means amazing observations of the rings of Saturn, features on Mars, the tangled atmosphere of Jupiter and the phases of Venus. Globular clusters will reveal thousands of stars and nebulae will show filaments of gas floating in the dark sky. On top of that, the fast f/5 focal ratio is perfect for astrophotography.</p><p><strong>Equatorial Mount Features </strong></p><p> The equatorial mount offers the convenience to compensate the Earth’s rotation. That is a great advantage for high resolution observation as it is only necessary to turn a single knob whilst tracking an object across the sky. The EQ3 is a lightweight German equatorial mount that easily bears the weight of the Sky-Watcher 150/750. The altitude and azimuth fine adjustment knobs make the polar alignment easy while the gears ensure accurate tracking. The heavy duty aluminium tripod increases the stability of the telescope and reduces vibration due to wind.</p><p> Aligning an equatorial mount is an easy operation that can be completed in a few minutes. Once the tripod is levelled and the mount is orientated south, incline the mount at the same angle of your local latitude. For example, if you are in Sydney (latitude 33° South), adjust the mount inclination to 33° above the horizon using the scale on the EQ3 mount.</p><p> The tracking can be performed by the optional dual-axis motors that can be easily connected to the mount. The computerised SynScan system is the ultimate upgrade that allows automatic pointing and tracking of more than 42,000 object in the sky! This option will save time when finding planets and deep sky objects in the vastness of the night sky.</p><p><strong>In the Box:</strong></p><ul> <li>150mm Newton Reflector</li> <li>EQ3 Mount with Aluminium Tripod</li> <li>2 Eyepieces Super 10mm (75x) & Super 25mm (30x) – 1.25″ Barrel</li> <li>6×30 Finderscope</li> <li>Telescope Eyepiece Adapter from 2″ to 1.25″ with T2 Thread</li> <li>Instruction Manual</li></ul>",

In fact, the AZ-EQ5 is a hybrid mount usable in both these configurations. The equatorial mode is ideal for astrophotography while the alt-azimuth configuration is more practical for observation as polar alignment is not required. Moreover, two telescopes can be simultaneously mounted in alt-azimuth configuration.</p><p>The exceptional SynScan Go-To system allows full control of both R.A. and Dec. axes with 9 slew speeds and 5 arcminute pointing precision, allowing you to quickly and accurately locate objects across the night sky. The Go-To system can automatically slew the telescope on command toward planets, stars, nebulae, galaxies, clusters and much more. The SynScan has 42,900 memorised celestial objects for an amazing journey in the night sky. The Deep Sky Tour function suggests a list of the most interesting deep sky objects currently visible, so even the novice astronomer can easily observe faint objects at the touch of a button. Once achieving alignment, the patented Freedom Find™ dual encoders will then keep track of your position to within 4.2 arcminutes. The mount will retain alignment even after releasing the clutches and manually pointing the scope to a new part of the sky.</p><p>The AZ-EQ5 is equipped with two SNAP ports for dual control of camera shutter release. Working with the SynScan hand control’s “Camera Control” function, a user can take batch exposures in up to 8 groups of “Exposure-time & Frames”. An indexer on the R.A. worm gear keeps track of its current position, so that the Periodic Error inherent to all worm gear driven mounts can be learned and permanently corrected for.

Newtonian reflector telescopes are among the most cost effective design on the market, reaching much larger apertures than an equivalently priced refractor. The large aperture will help resolve faint, extended objects like nebulae and galaxies, whilst the 650mm focal length will reveal fine details of lunar craters.</p><p> The 130/650 Photo Reflector is equipped with an excellent Crayford dual speed focuser allowing fast, coarse regulation followed by a precise 10:1 reduction adjustment knob to reach the optimal focus. A 3 element 28mm LET eyepiece is provided, allowing 23x magnification and a 56° apparent field of view with 20mm of eye relief. The aluminised primary mirror is aspheric (parabolic profile) offering an optical system free from spherical aberration. The secondary mirror is thin to allow fast cooling and it is held by extra thin spider supports for minimal diffraction spike effects on bright stars and increased contrast.</p><p><strong>In The Box:</strong></p><ul> <li>Sky-Watcher Black Diamond 130/650 Photo Reflector OTA</li> <li>28mm LET Eyepiece</li> <li>8×50 Finder Scope</li> <li>130mm Tube Rings</li> <li>Dovetail Bar</li></ul>",

And now, to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy, Sky-Watcher is proud to present the commemorative edition of Newton’s Telescope – Heritage.</p><p> Designed to be fully functional telescope, this Sky-Watcher Heritage-90 Virtuoso Dobsonian Telescope is very simple and easy to use, an ideal gift for young astronomer. Equipped with a Virtuoso™ mount with Freedom-Find™ technology, it allows the telescope to be manually manoeuvred in either axis without disrupting the polar alignment; thus creating freedom and convenience to users using the telescope. Besides, the setup also offers camera/video cruising through six preset positions at five different speeds. This ensures smooth picture acquisition of the object without causing it to run off from the field of view.</p><p> Nonetheless, the Virtuoso mount can be further upgraded to a GO-TO system by installing the Synscan AZ GO-TO handset and cable.</p><p> <strong >Sky-Watcher Heritage-90 Virtuoso Dobsonian Telescope Features:</strong ></p><ul> <li>Perfect For Beginners</li> <li>90mm High Contrast Maksutov-Cassegrain Optics</li> <li>Camera/Video Cruising up to 6 preset positions</li> <li>5 Different Cruising Speed Modes</li> <li>Virtuoso™ Mount Stable Platform</li> <li>Can be upgraded to GO-TO System</li> <li>5 Years Sky-Watcher Limited Warranty</li></ul>",

It will be very confusing when you are trying to track a moving boat or flying bird. This problem can be corrected easily by using a erect image diagonal</p><p> Simply remove the standard diagonal from the telescope’s focuser or visual back, and install the Sky-Watcher Erect Image Diagonal, then when you insert an eyepiece, objects will be right side up and left-to-right correct. These Amici prism diagonals are very comfortable for daytime observations, where the telescope is often in a horizontal position.</p>",
